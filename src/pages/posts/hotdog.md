### Ingredients:

- 3 pounds ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination)
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon mustard seed
- 1 teaspoon marjoram
- 1/2 teaspoon mace
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1 egg white
- 1/4 cup milk
- Collagen casings (4 feet, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter)
- Vinegar solution (1 tablespoon vinegar per cup of water)

### Instructions:

1. Grind the meat: Use a meat grinder or a food processor to grind the meat into a fine consistency.
2. Prepare the seasonings: In a food processor, puree the onion, garlic, coriander, paprika, mustard seed, marjoram, and mace. Add the milk, egg white, sugar, salt, and pepper, and combine well.
3. Combine meat and seasonings: Add the pureed seasonings to the ground meat and mix with your hands. Wet your hands with cold water to prevent the mixture from sticking.
4. Refrigerate and re-grind: Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes and then grind it again to ensure a uniform texture.
5. Prepare the casings: Rinse the collagen casings under cool running water to remove salt. Soak them in a bowl of cool water and vinegar solution for 30 minutes. Run cool water over the casings, and then rinse them well and drain.
6. Stuff the casings: Using a sausage stuffer or a piping bag, fill the casings with the meat mixture and twist them off into 6-inch links.
7. Parboil the hot dogs: Parboil the links in simmering water for 20 minutes.
8. Chill and store: Remove the hot dogs from the water, pat them dry, and refrigerate them. They can be stored for up to one week or frozen for future use.

### Alternative Cooking Methods:

- Oven Roasting: Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C). With a knife, make a slice about halfway through the hot dog. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and the interior is cooked through.
- Boiling: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the hot dogs and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the hot dogs reach an internal temperature of at least 140째F (60째C).

### Tips and Variations:

- Use a combination of meats, such as beef and pork, for a unique flavor profile.
- Experiment with different seasonings, such as smoked paprika or garlic powder, to create unique flavor variations.
- For a more authentic hot dog experience, serve with a toasted bun, condiments, and your favorite toppings.

Remember to always follow proper food safety guidelines when handling and cooking your homemade hot dogs. Enjoy!
